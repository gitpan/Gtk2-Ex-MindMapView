Gtk2-Ex-MindMapView version 0.0.1

Gtk2-Ex-MindMapView displays an outline or mind map on a
Gnome2::Canvas. This module is an extension of the Gnome2::Canvas
which is a Gtk2::Widget, so it can be placed in any Gtk2 container.

This software allows you to create a balanced display of text items
each with a border. You may assign a font and change the color of the
mind map items. You may also create clickable URLs and display
pictures.

This is an alpha version of the software. It has been released in this
state so that I may receive feedback on it. All constructive feedback
is welcome.

This software should not be used for anything important. The
interfaces WILL change and any code you write that uses this software
will probably break on the next release.

You may run the examples that come with this software prior to the
install step. This will give you a glimpse of what it can do without
having to do the full install.
